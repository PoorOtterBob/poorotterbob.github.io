<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I was born in Shenzhen, Guangdong Pronvince. I received my B.Sc. degree in School of Mathematics in June 2023 from Hunan University. In the same year, I was admitted to pursue a M.Sc. degree in School of Data Science, University of Science and Technology of China without entrance examination. I am a member in the Data Intelligence Lab. 

My research interest includes Graph Neraul Network and Partial Differential Equations, especially in terms of the expressive power of Graph Representation Learning. I am currently researching the application of continual learning and few-shot learning on traffic prediction in graph-based scenarios. <!-- I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

# 😊 About me
Hi! I’m Jiaming Ma, a second-year Master’s student in the School of AI+DS at USTC, as a member in [Data Intelligence Lab](http://di.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) advised by Prof. [Yang Wang](http://di.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/14/f7/5367/template5367/PersonalSite/index.html) and Dr. [Binwu Wang](http://di.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/14/f7/5367/template5367/MembersSite/wbw/index.html).<!--I was born in Shenzhen, Guangdong Pronvince. I received my B.Sc. degree in School of Mathematics in June 2023 from Hunan University. In the same year, I was admitted to pursue a M.Sc. degree in School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, University of Science and Technology of China without entrance examination. -->

I am dedicated to making a contribution to the advancement of AI🧠 and DS📊. My research interests lie in a wide range of intersection of Graph Neraul Networks and Algebraic, Optimization and Partial Differential Equations, especially in terms of the theory of Graph Representation Learning, and the application of Metric Embeddings and Robust Optimization. My current research focuses on the application of out-of-distribution learning and zero-shot learning on spatio-temporal prediction in graph-based scenarios. <!-- I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

I look forward to working with collaborators from different scientific backgrounds on a wide range of topics in Deep Learning that are strongly related to Mathematics. Fell free to email me :)

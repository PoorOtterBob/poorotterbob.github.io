# 😊 About me
Hi! I’m Jiaming Ma, a graduate student in the School of AI+DS at USTC. My research interests lie in a wide range of intersection of Deep Learning Architecture (e.g. Transformer and GNN) and Optimization. My current research applications focus on the following areas: 

- 🤖 LLM Architecture and -based Agent System;
- ⏱️ Time Series Forecasting;
- ⚖️ Graph Representation Learning;
- 🚗 Large-scale and Out-of-Distribution Spatiotemporal Learning;

I have been fully engaged in every publication from start to finish with hands-on guidance on methodology, theory, experimental validation, and manuscript writing and figure preparation. I look forward to working with collaborators from different scientific backgrounds on a wide range of topics in Deep Learning that are strongly related to Mathematics. Fell free to email me : )
<!--I am dedicated to making a contribution to the advancement of AI🧠 and DS📊.  , as a member in [Data Intelligence Lab](http://di.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) advised by Prof. [Yang Wang](http://di.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/15/71/5489/template5489/PersonalSite/index.html) and Dr. [Binwu Wang](https://continualgoing.github.io/).,I was born in Shenzhen, Guangdong Pronvince. I received my B.Sc. degree in School of Mathematics in June 2023 from Hunan University. In the same year, I was admitted to pursue a M.Sc. degree in School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, University of Science and Technology of China without entrance examination. -->




<!-- ① Large-scale and Out-of-Distribution Spatiotemporal Learning🚗, ② Time Series Forecasting⏱️, ③ Imbalanced Graph Classification⚖️, ④ LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems🤖, and ⑤ Any Potential Graph-Based Scenarios👍!

# 😊 About me
Hi! I’m Jiaming Ma, a Ph.D. student in the School of AI+DS at USTC, as a member in [Data Intelligence Lab](http://di.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) advised by Prof. [Yang Wang](http://di.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/15/71/5489/template5489/PersonalSite/index.html) and Dr. [Binwu Wang](https://continualgoing.github.io/).<!--I was born in Shenzhen, Guangdong Pronvince. I received my B.Sc. degree in School of Mathematics in June 2023 from Hunan University. In the same year, I was admitted to pursue a M.Sc. degree in School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, University of Science and Technology of China without entrance examination. -->

I have been fully engaged in every publication from start to finish with hands-on guidance on methodology, theory, experimental validation, and manuscript writing and figure preparation. I am dedicated to making a contribution to the advancement of AI🧠 and DS📊. My research interests lie in a wide range of intersection of Deep Learning Structure (e.g. Transformer and GNN) and Algebraic, Optimization and Partial Differential Equations. My current research applications focus on the following areas: 
- 🚗 Large-scale and Out-of-Distribution Spatiotemporal Learning;
- ⏱️ Time Series Forecasting;
- ⚖️ Imbalanced Graph Classification;
- 🤖 LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems;
- 👍 Any Potential Graph-Based Scenarios;


<!-- ① Large-scale and Out-of-Distribution Spatiotemporal Learning🚗, ② Time Series Forecasting⏱️, ③ Imbalanced Graph Classification⚖️, ④ LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems🤖, and ⑤ Any Potential Graph-Based Scenarios👍!  I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->



I look forward to working with collaborators from different scientific backgrounds on a wide range of topics in Deep Learning that are strongly related to Mathematics. Fell free to email me : )
